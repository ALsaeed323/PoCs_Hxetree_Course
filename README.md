This repository contains Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and walkthroughs for challenges covered in the Hextree Android Penetration Testing Course. Each challenge, or "flag", simulates a specific real-world Android vulnerability and demonstrates how it can be identified and exploited.


🔍 What’s Inside:
⚑ Flag-Based Structure: Each subfolder represents a unique Android security challenge (Flag01, Flag02, …), ranging from basic misconfigurations to advanced exploitation.

🛠️ PoC Exploits: Hands-on code snippets and payloads demonstrating how each vulnerability can be identified and exploited.
